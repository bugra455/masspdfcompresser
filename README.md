## Mass PDF Compresser

### Basic PDF compresser that i made for compressing my comics to my kindle. Based on Ghostscript and BASH 

To Run:
```
//First make it executable
chmod +x compresser.sh
//and run it with bash
bash ./compresser.sh "path of the folder that your items are in"
```
It will create a folder called "output" in this directory and put your items in it.

Maybe one day i will make this more modular and add more selections (maybe a NCURSES UI too), but for now im too lazy to learn the depths of PDF compressing and thÄ±s one just works fine
